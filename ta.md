# Key Takeaways from the SFX (SecureFileXchange) Project

1. **Architecture**
   - Client-Server model with Java client and Python server
   - Modern tech stack using Java 17+ and Python 3.10+
   - Microservices architecture with Docker containerization

2. **Security Features**
   - Cryptography implementations (AES/RSA)
   - Secure Remote Password (SRP6) authentication
   - Two-Factor Authentication (TOTP)
   - Diffie-Hellman key exchange
   - Audit logging capabilities

3. **Development Practices**
   - Test-driven development with JUnit 5 and pytest
   - CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
   - Containerized deployment ready
   - Clear project structure separation

4. **Technology Stack**
   - Frontend: JavaFX for GUI
   - Backend: FastAPI (Python)
   - Database: SQLAlchemy for ORM
   - Build Tools: Maven (Java) and pip (Python)
